Description: Recursively merge hashes
 Deep Merge is a simple set of utility functions for Hash. It permits
 you to merge elements inside a hash together recursively. The manner
 by which it does this is somewhat arbitrary (since there is no defining
 standard for this) but it should end up being pretty intuitive and do what
 you expect.
